I worked on my Windows PC on some code snippets related to the optimization of the random number generator.  I determined that I can not come up with a very efficient replacment at this time and I plan to table this until a later time and start working on the instruction commands as I have detemrined that some of them take quite long to perform.  I also collected all the dump files ~8GB from the week of running nanopond on my computer.  I am now working on making a script that will read through the csv and return the count of the clock, totalEnergy, totalActiveCells, total ViableReplicators, and maxGeneration.  I spent far too much time working on the survey and trying to learn some of the concepts introduced to me in this context.  I have a better understanding of some of the concepts.
